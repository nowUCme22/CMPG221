# CMPG221 – Data Structures and Algorithms (2nd Year)

This repository contains the **introductory Java project** completed at the start of the **CMPG221** module during the second semester of my second year in the **BSc Information Technology** program at **North-West University (NWU)**.  
The purpose of this project was to **demonstrate programming and object-oriented principles** learned in **CMPG211**, before beginning formal studies on data structures and algorithms later in the semester.

## 🧠 What This Repo Covers

- Review and application of **Java programming fundamentals**  
- Demonstration of **object-oriented design** (classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation)  
- Use of **constructors, inheritance, and relationships** between objects  
- Implementation of **logical operations and data handling**  
- Foundation work leading into **data structures and algorithmic problem-solving**

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### 📂 F1_Project/
A Java application created as a **bridge project** to showcase programming, logic, and OOP knowledge from CMPG211.

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Constructor.java` | Represents Formula 1 constructors (teams) and their attributes. |
| `Driver.java` | Defines F1 driver information, including statistics and association with teams. |
| `F1Teams.java` | Manages teams and drivers collectively using Java classes and relationships. |
| `TestTeams.java` | Main testing class that executes the application and outputs results. |
| `assignment1/` | Folder containing all compiled `.class` and source `.java` files for the project. |

## 🏎️ Project Overview

### 🏁 F1 Team Management System

The **Formula 1 Team Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to organize and manage Formula 1 constructors and drivers.  
It applies **object-oriented programming concepts** such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modular class design.

#### ⚙️ Key Features
- Create and manage multiple teams and drivers  
- Display relationships between constructors and their drivers  
- Demonstrate data organization using objects and attributes  
- Apply object-oriented principles to a real-world simulation scenario  
- Output structured and formatted data to the console  

#### 💡 Concepts Demonstrated
- Classes, constructors, and object instantiation  
- Composition and relationships between objects  
- Modular program structure  
- Method creation and encapsulation of logic  
- Reuse of CMPG211 concepts in an integrated application

## 🧩 Module Context

This project served as an **introductory coding task** for CMPG221, before starting formal work on:
- Algorithm design and analysis  
- Big O notation  
- Recursion and iteration  
- Abstract data types (stacks, queues, lists, etc.)  
- Searching and sorting algorithms  

The focus of this task was to **bridge** the first-semester programming knowledge (CMPG211) with the second-semester theory of data structures and algorithms.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to consolidate prior Java knowledge into a larger program  
- Applying OOP principles in a structured, multi-class system  
- Building clean, maintainable codebases in Java  
- Strengthening understanding of relationships between classes and objects  
- Preparing for data structure design and algorithmic thinking

## 📎 Notes

All files were created and submitted during the **2025 academic year**.  
This was the first project in CMPG221 and focused primarily on **object-oriented programming**, **class interaction**, and **logical program design**, setting the foundation for the upcoming data structure topics.
